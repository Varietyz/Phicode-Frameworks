Guide
Any experience lamps or book of knowledge received through random events or Achievement Diaries can be used on any skill of the player's choosing, either to shorten the next bit of training in the guide or to save time later on, although for ironmen it is recommended to use them on HerbloreHerblore. If a player is planning to train Herblore or Construction past those requirements necessary to complete all quests, they should consider prioritising the use of lamps or optional quest rewards toward those skills. When Slayer is trained on the side, it is recommended to use Konar as soon as possible, due to the possibility to loot Magic logs from the Brimstone chest, these are required for Desert Treasure I.

Somewhat experienced players ought to use their player-owned house to teleport across Gielinor to finish various quests. At level 50 Construction you can use portal chambers, mounted glories and oak altars. But the more useful unlocks, such as additional teleportation options and stat-restoring features, require substantially higher Construction levels and are therefore rather expensive. To get there you want to use the Teleport to house tablets, which can also be used as emergency teleports.

New players on a budget should use games necklace(8) to teleport around or for access to a bank. You should also look at finishing some diaries to get your hands on some unlimited teleports which will be of great use throughout the game. Notable examples include the Ardougne cloak 1 which gives you unlimited teleport close to an altar to restore your Prayer, and from where you can run east to a fairy ring or west to a spirit tree. It also gives access to the Ardougne area early in the game, which is very useful. The Ectophial is useful for emergency teleports and for getting to the Morytania area.

This list does not include suggestions for combat levels. Boss fights might prove to be very challenging to do with the stats listed here. Always make sure to train up your combat stats to a level at which you're confident you can kill or survive dangerous parts of the listed quests.
If the additional info mentions: "Buy 3 silk" for example, do not hesitate to use the silk in a certain quest afterwards, that's why it was mentioned. Not every mention of the need to buy something has a direct mention of why to do this. So do not hesitate to use the items you have gathered. Make sure to stock enough common items, like ropes, buckets, pots, etc. If you encounter other useful tools like moulds, axes and fishing equipment make sure to bank those as well. Have a look at tools page for a useful list.
